Prims Algorithm Visualizer built using OpenGL graphic API of C++.

It allows users to define their own graph and edges between them and 

gives you more interaction like undo, redo, getting the matrix representation

of the graph so formed and finally gives you the Minimum spanning tree using 

the prim's algorithm :smile:


Steps to use :

1. Clone the repo or download the code

2. Install the necessary libraries like OpenGL glut version etc.

3. Compile the code using the command `g++ Prims_Visualizer.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut`

4. Then just run the file using the `./a.out` command in linux 

5. Note : Compiling and running the program in window may requires the different setup
	      so do check that out on the web.

6. Yeah you are good to go by now !!
